        We've talked about the core of what it takes to do a good LARP, which is
applicable to many different flavors of games. There are additional ideas
which factor in if you're running a live-combat game, or a horde game, or a
serious murder mystery, or any of the other many styles.

        Keep the structure of the game in mind, and how it might flow. Be careful
not to break the game into smaller pieces, breaking the interconnections.

        Make sure the characters are consistent with each other. If an event

        Writing a good LARP will always take longer than you expect. Give
yourself plenty of time. Don't wait for the last minute.

        With time, you can bounce ideas off of other writers. They can provide a
much needed sanity check. You will write goofy things.

        With time, you can review, revise, and check for consistency. You can give

fresh eyes.

        As you write, play in other people's LARPs. There is no better way to learn
what works and what doesn't. It's also fun, stimulating new ideas.

        "The most dangerous thought that you can have as a creative person is to
think that you know what you're doing, because once you think you know
what you're doing you stop looking around for other ways of doing things
and you stop being able to see other ways of doing things. You become
blind." - Bret Victor
