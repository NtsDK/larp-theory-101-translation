  <h2>Twelve Rules to Live By</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        There are a dozen useful rules to keep in mind as you're designing and
writing a LARP.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        These are guidelines that shouldn't be broken.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        They're nothing new - I wrote these rules for a Usenet discussion in 1997;
they worked for me before then, and I use them to this day.

<section class="slide" id="Rule 1: Interesting Characters" label="Rule 1: Interesting Characters">
  <h2>Rule 1: Interesting Characters</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        Role-playing is about getting inside the head of another person and letting
them live for a while.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Characters should be rich, full characters with shades of gray.
      </p>

three and they're happy." Robin Tunney from <i>The Mentalist</i>
      </p>

    <li>
      <p>
        There has to be more than just shtic, though. An accent or a limp is not
enough.

<section class="slide" id="Rule 2: Interesting Stories" label="Rule 2: Interesting Stories">
  <h2>Rule 2: Interesting Stories</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        Not plots - stories. They are NOT the same.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Life is a tale, with a complex set of events and people that have gotten you
to this point.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Characters should be similarly detailed, with information that helps the
player know and understand them.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Give the players things they can talk about in game, ways that they can
connect to other characters.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>

<section class="slide" id="Rule 3: Human Stories" label="Rule 3: Human Stories">
  <h2>Rule 3: Human Stories</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        The most memorable stories are the ones that deal with the things that
make us who and what we are.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Life, love, loss, birth, death, failure, success...
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        They can be very simple at their heart, but very, very powerful to play.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        You don't even have to be human to tell human stories. <i>Dustpan: The LARP</i>
has a cat's hairball as a character, and it's wrestling with issues of identity
and loss.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Saving the world stories are highly overrated and cliche.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <span class="hidden">
  There's not a single human character in Dustpan, but they all have human drama.

<section class="slide" id="Rule 4: Tough Decisions" label="Rule 4: Tough Decisions">
  <h2>Rule 4: Tough Decisions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        Put the character on the spot. Make them choose between difficult options.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Black and white decisions can be too easy. The more shades of gray, the
better. 
      </p>
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Do I keep a sacred oath that I've been entrusted with, and, by doing so,
  allow a war to break out, one that will kill millions? Do I break the oath,
  challenge my religious tenets, risk my own imminent death, all to save
  nameless strangers? How do I decide this as I am scrambling to recover
  something that could bring death and destruction on my own people,
  some of whom have interpreted my attempts to help them as heresy?
  (<i>Tabula Rasa v2.0</i>)
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        Give the player a good reason for each of the options.

  <h2>Rule 5: Repercussions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        There have to be repercussions.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Pulling a gun in real life is not a trivial act, yet look how often it happens
in LARPs.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        I should not be able to get away with murder. 
      </p>

    <li>

        Make the players live with the consequences of their actions, and give
those consequences teeth.

  <h2>Rule 6: Things to Do In Game</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        You can never have too many plots.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Too many games are seriously underplotted, where things drag for some
(or all) of the characters, especially in longer games.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        The real fun happens when a player realizes that she's been running nonstop for the entire game, without a moment to catch her breath.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        A bored player is a dangerous player. They can wreck a game.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <span class="hidden">
  Notes:
  A bored player, with a gun, in a game where there are no consequences on opening fire, can ruin the experience for everyone, especially you. The story of
that will live on in the LARP community.

  <h2>Rule 7: A Chance to be Noticed</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        All players aren't created equal. Some are better at playing than others.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        All characters should be more equal.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Everyone should have a chance for a great part, for a dramatic moment, or
a time when everyone turns to them for an answer.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Why would I want to play Third Spear Carrier from the Left? Why is my
character's story less important than someone else's?
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        You never know when someone is really going to surprise you.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <span class="hidden">
  Notes:
  When people came out of Conjunction, everyone was arguing, because everyone believed that the 20+ character game had been centered around them.
That's ideal.

<section class="slide" id="Rule 8: Try Something Different" label="Rule 8: Try Something Different">
  <h2>Rule 8: Try Something Different</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        Players get typecast. Roles get typecast. LARPs get typecast. Plots get
typecast. Cliche is boring. How many times have you seen:
      </p>
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          The king/Vampire Prince/boss/head of the family is dead
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Pregnant teenage angst
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Trapped in a house during a storm with a psycho killer
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        Just as players need to stretch their role-playing muscles, writers need to
stretch their plotting and character-writing muscles.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Switch it up. Find a new twist. Learn from other writers and games.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <span class="hidden">
These stories can work, if you bring something new to them. !
This also applies to casting... Sure - I might be exactly what you see as the person to play General Hiram Cork, the blood and guts boss of the San Inguon military base and defender of
America against the Commie threat. However, I might also like the chance to play
Tony "Scooter" Turrelli, the unappreciated teenager who was always 2nd in everything at the local school. One is a commanding role, in the middle of a lot of the action, driving the game at
every turn. The other is far more of a
character role, dealing with the far more mundane crises of adolescence. I might not be what you had in mind for the part - and I might not be the best person to play the part - but give me
the chance. (In my case, I actually played both
characters in diferent runs of "I Was a Teenage Mutant From Outer Space!" Both were great fun!)

<section class="slide" id="Rule 9: A Character Involved" label="Rule 9: A Character Involved">
  <h2>Rule 9: A Character Involved</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        Outsiders who have little connection to a game aren't much fun.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Characters that are ostracized by everyone can quickly lose their luster.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Why should I play a character who is only there to be abused?
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Make sure every character has connections to several others in game, in
some way. Give them reasons to talk to each other.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <span class="hidden">
  Notes:
It doesn't have to be some sequence of cosmic coincidences in the backstory. The stranger who turns out to be a medic can be very valuable. !
An uninvolved/ostracized character can get bored very quickly. In Return to Bora Gora, I was ostracized. I was also the only one with the combination to the safe with the nuke. There was
panic when I went missing.

<section class="slide" id="Rule 10: A Chance at Success" label="Rule 10: A Chance at Success">
  <h2>Rule 10: A Chance at Success</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        You can stack the odds against me - but as long as I think there's a chance,
I'll be engaged and I'll have fun.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        If a character's only purpose is to go down for the big fall, then it's
probably not going to be fun. If I don't stand a chance, and all there is to do
is to flail at impossible goals, I won't be happy
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Unless you tell me about it <i>beforehand</i>, so the player can plan accordingly.
They can play it for all it's worth. This rewrites the goals - the meaning of
"success" becomes very different. The doomed character can give their
opponents a real challenge, and that makes a better game for everyone.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <span class="hidden">
  Notes:
You've worked very hard to set up contradicting goals in characters. Why risk it by having a player rewrite their own goals? !
Don't change the rules of the game halfway through.

<section class="slide" id="Rule 11: Making the Best of Good Players" label="Rule 11: Making the Best of Good Players">
  <h2>Rule 11: Making the Best of Good Players</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        Nothing makes a game greater for a player than the chance to interact with
someone who's really good at it. It usually makes their own play better.
Give them the chance to do so whenever you can.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Good players can make a weak game stronger, and can pull other people
along in the process.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Chemistry happens with the right elements.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        You never know where those combinations are going to come from, so you
have to mix people up. 
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        This means you want a LOT of interactions, among a lot of characters.
      </p>

I call them the "Phone Book Players" - you can throw anything at them and the game will be great.

<section class="slide" id="Rule 12: Play without Interruption" label="Rule 12: Play without Interruption">
  <h2>Rule 12: Play without Interruption</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        When my character gets rolling, don't stop me. Nothing breaks a game
faster for me than having to step out and do something to facilitate the
game.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        I <i>never</i> want to roll a die, throw Rock/Paper/Scissors, add a modifier,
reread a special ability card, search through index cards for an item, or
remember some mechanic, if I don't have to. It breaks the role-playing. It
breaks the mood.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Consider the great moments you've had when LARPing. The really great
moments probably came when you were pouring your heart and soul into
the character, without a mechanic in sight.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <span class="hidden">
  Notes:
Confessing my sins and my heresy to the Pope, one on one. Competing socially with Lancelot to try to keep Guenevere with me, even as I knew I was
losing. Painting a canvas as a Toreador vampire, keeping the easel between me and the Hunters who were there in an uneasy truce.
