        You’ve been writing story concepts, To Dos, character bits, plots, and goals.
How many are enough?
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        That all depends on the story and sub-stories you’re trying to tell. You can
tell a simple, elegant, and powerful story with two or three characters, in a
handful of triangles. You can tell a lot more stories with more triangles and
characters.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
       You can decide up front about how many characters you want in the game,
and that will help drive your process - but don’t be limited by a strict
number up front. Consider it an estimate, and work from there.
      </p>

       If you’re doing it right, the characters will tell you when there is a
complete set.

  Idol Hands of Death started with 20 characters. After the first run, I realized that there were a couple of dangling threads and loose ends. We also had 22 signups for the second run. Tim
Lasko and I sat down and talked about our experiences in the game - and soon had two new characters that filled in some of the holes. They helped to fill out the stories. Players in the
second and third run never realized that we’d added characters. For the fourth run, we realized that we still had some holes, and we knew how we could fill them. Three new characters, tied
in with the others, worked brilliantly. They fit in so well that one of the new characters has gotten several votes as the potential killer, in both of the runs where they were present.

  <h2>There are Limits</h2>
  <ul>

        You can only expect a limited number of connections and conversations in
a given amount of time. 
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Theoretically, this limits the number of characters you should have for a
given game length: 20-30 = 4 hours, 30-40 = 8 hours, and 50-60 = weekend.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
       This also depends on your players and their style. Some players can take a
three player LARP and go for hours. Others are just the opposite.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
       Realistically, most characters aren’t going to interact with everyone.
Characters work with smaller groups, going outside the group as
necessary, especially in bigger games, where characters can’t be as densely
tied together.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
<span class="hidden">
  Keep this in mind when writing “Find the McGu ! fn” plots. Characters won’t talk with everyone.
In Lullaby of Broadway 3, As Arthur, I spent most of the weekend with Guenevere and Lancelot. I talked to quite a few of the others, but really was focused
on our story. I couldn’t tell you what happened with the rest of the game.

      </p>

    <li>
      <p>
        When you drop a character, you’re tearing a hole in the dense web of
interactions you’ve carefully constructed. Some To Dos will be impossible
to complete. Some information will not be as accessible. (If this is the only
source of that information, go back and fix that.) 
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
       This is hard to plan for. It can be done. 
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
       Never write an “extra” character, that is somehow less. The players will
know. All the characters should be equal and integrated with each other.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
       Letting characters get killed off mid-game has similar issues. Writing a
good replacement character is very tough to do well.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <span class="hidden">
I personally don’t do this. Even with Idol Hands growing from 20 to 22 to 25 characters, those new parts are fully integrated. Remove one and the game
wouldn’t work as well.

  <h2>12 Characters Walk Into A Bar...</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        Your characters have spoken, and you have a good idea for the size of the
game. You’ve considered the web of interactions. How long should the
game run?
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        That depends on a couple of factors:
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
       Are you going to put everything into the characters at game start? 
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
       Are you going to introduce external events and <i>significant</i> new information
during the game? (<i>e.g.</i> pages of restored memories)
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
       Are you using mechanics that will take a long time to resolve if things end
in a massive conflict?
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <span class="hidden">
Inserting information takes time, and information takes time to propagate through the game. !
Variable numbers of characters are hard, because the number of interactions changes dramatically. Plots can break. Start simple, and use a fixed number -
unless you’re doing something like a horde game.

        Your estimates are TOO LONG.
      </p>

    <li>
      <p>
        Be merciless. I’ve rarely met a game that couldn’t be compressed in time.
Doing so puts pressure on the players to act. Time pressure also helps to
prevent slow periods.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
       Give your players a lot to do and not enough time to accomplish
everything. Force them to choose their priorities. Yes, this means that many
of your possible To Dos won’t get finished, but you still have to write
them.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
       Leave the players wanting more. That’s so much better than having
everyone just standing around waiting for the last two people to finish up
their last plot.
