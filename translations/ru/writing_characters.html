        A game is a collection of characters with things they have to do,
individually and/or collectively. The details and directions that a LARP
will take depend on how those characters will see their tasks and goals,
and how the player interprets them.

        A To Do will be approached very differently depending on whether the
character is a tarnished saint, a depraved sociopath, a sinner seeking
absolution, a selfish manipulator looking only to their own ends, or
something entirely different.

        "You don't remember." is the shortest legitimate character sheet I know.
