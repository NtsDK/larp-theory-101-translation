  <h2>Who Am I To Talk About LARP?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        These are the rules and guidelines that work for me and other LARP
authors I respect.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        They are general rules, applicable to LARPs of all styles and genres.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Any rule can be bent, or even broken, if you're careful. Usually, breaking a
rule just leads to avoidable problems.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Learn from the successes and failures of others. Play other games, other
systems, other genres, and other styles.

  <h2>So, what is LARP?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        A LARP is live action. It has people interacting with each other, acting out
their intentions. The players don’t describe actions to a moderating GM.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        A LARP tells a story. It may be small or it may be epic.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        A LARP has players playing characters with character-specific goals.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        A LARP is improvised. Players make choices and drive the action, outside
of Game Master control.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        A LARP has no audience. The players are the audience.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        This definition is squishy and open-ended. There’s a lot that LARP can be.
Don’t be afraid to experiment.
