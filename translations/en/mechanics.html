  <h2>Mechanics</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        You may have gathered I’m not a big fan of mechanics. 
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Mechanics interrupt the flow of role-playing and characterization.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Mechanics break the mood.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Mechanics create time bubbles, where players can’t be reached, and
connections are broken.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Mechanics take time to explain on paper and during game briefing, take
time to run, and, with a player like me, need a GM to get “right.”
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Mechanics suck up GM time, which can mean players waiting in line to get
to a GM. No one wants to wait in line while other action is going on.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
 There are war stories of horrible games where nearly every action required waiting in line for a GM. !
If I really wanted to play a tabletop game or a war game, I wouldn’t be at a LARP.

  <h2>So How Do You Do Odd Things?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        Why are you doing this? What are you trying to accomplish in game? Do
you really need this to tell the story you’re trying to tell? 
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        The first option is not to do them. You can write great games without them.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        The second option is to run with “GM Sanctioned Mayhem Only,” which
means if a player wants to do something, they go to a GM who figures out
what happens. There’s no need for statistics or detailed special ability
cards, because the GM keeps this in their head.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        If you must have player-driven mechanics, then Keep It As Simple As
Possible. Remember that the player is going to be fumbling through ability
cards, looking up numbers on the character sheet, and struggling to make
something happen.
      </p>

  <h2>But I have this Really Cool System!</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        That’s what everyone thinks, until the players get their hands on it.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        If you must have a system, write it all down first, well before the game.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Find a handful of playtesters who have never heard of your system, who
have not been in the design meetings, who are not practiced at such things.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Brief them as you would for the game and then playtest the system. Watch
how people struggle with it. Fix the problems and repeat the playtesting.
Continue until it works or you give up.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Make sure that you have extra GMs at runtime to help handle this. Make
sure that they are practiced with the mechanics. It’s a bad sign if the player
has to explain the system to the GM.
      </p>

<section class="slide" id="Item Cards are a Mechanic, Too" label="Item Cards are a Mechanic, Too">
  <h2>Item Cards are a Mechanic, Too</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        How many games have you been in where you are given a stack of index
cards representing items you have in game?
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        How many times have you struggled to find a specific item by searching
through all of the things in your packets?
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Compare the play experience of handing a “Holy Hand Grenade of St.
Antioch” item card to a GM versus carrying the Hand Grenade and then
trying to lob it, on the count of five, at someone playing the Vorpal Bunny.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Use real props or close facsimiles whenever possible - unless the game may
be exposed to nonplayers. Then fake guns, other weapons, bombs, drugs,
and other potentially sensitive objects should not be used.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  Or digging in soft soil looking for body parts, or disassembling a nuclear generator to make a bomb, or just trying to conceal a bulging folder of secret
information. It adds greatly to the play experience. !
Just remember: Thou Shalt Not Freak the Mundanes.

<section class="slide" id="Don’t Confuse a Prop With A Plot" label="Don’t Confuse a Prop With A Plot">
  <h2>Don’t Confuse a Prop With A Plot</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        A cool prop is not a plot or a To Do.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Cool scenery and set dressings don’t help players who are standing around
bored.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Consider the stories, the To Dos, the plots, and the characters. If they can’t
stand on their own, running powerfully in a bare room, then all the props
and set dressings in the world aren’t going to help.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
There’s a LARP group out there that I won’t name. They pride themselves on their prop creation skills, and go around teaching them. They’ve built some
imaginative materials, better than in most games. Their props are great, but their games have a reputation for stinking. They’ve confused creating a cool
setting with creating a good game.
