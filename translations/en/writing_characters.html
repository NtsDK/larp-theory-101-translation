  <h2>Writing Characters</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        A game is a collection of characters with things they have to do,
individually and/or collectively. The details and directions that a LARP
will take depend on how those characters will see their tasks and goals,
and how the player interprets them.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        A To Do will be approached very differently depending on whether the
character is a tarnished saint, a depraved sociopath, a sinner seeking
absolution, a selfish manipulator looking only to their own ends, or
something entirely different.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
       Your job is to weave a character into the given set of goals. You probably
already have some good ideas about them, but listen as they tell you about
themselves. They may surprise you.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>

<section class="slide" id="How Long Should a Character Be?" label="How Long Should a Character Be?">
  <h2>How Long Should a Character Be?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        That depends on the number of To Dos, the length of the game, and the
depth you want to give your characters.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        "You don't remember." is the shortest legitimate character sheet I know.
That doesn't go very far. Either the character will get their memory back,
requiring a longer description, or other characters will have to know what
happened, which means their sheets are longer.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
       Three sentences can totally work, for a game like FOCUS: the Generic LARP.
There was a surprisingly rich environment, and everyone had a clear
archetype to play.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
       Three sentences (or less) can fail totally, like in Slave Girls of the Terror Dome,
where nothing was connected or made sense.

<section class="slide" id="Where Is the Character Information?" label="Where Is the Character Information?">
  <h2>Where Is the Character Information?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        Character information is often spread into several pieces. Consider a game
with d'Artagnan, of The Three Musketeers. From most specific to most
generic, details about his character could be:
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        In his character biography (e.g. d'Artagnan's personal history)
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
       Introduced in the game, via contingency envelopes or arrival information.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
       In small-group or description bluesheets (e.g. A Musketeer's bluesheet,
French court politics, etc.)
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
       In public materials (e.g. common knowledge of events at the court, history
of duels, etc.)
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
</section>




<section class="slide" id="Which of those Places Do I Choose?" label="Which of those Places Do I Choose?">
  <h2>Which of those Places Do I Choose?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        It's clearly easier and more private to put more useful and specific
information about how a character thinks in the most specific materials -
the character biography.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        To say that d'Artagnan was passionately in love with the Queen and how
he feels is not something publicly known.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
       If it's relevant, it belongs in the biography.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>

<section class="slide" id="How will the Choice Affect Game Play?" label="How will the Choice Affect Game Play?">
  <h2>How will the Choice Affect Game Play?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        Consider Armand, who is given a contingency envelope that says "Open
when you meet Esmerelda."
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Armand meets several characters, and then is introduced to Esmerelda.
Armand introduces himself as he has to all of the other characters he
doesn't know.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
       There's that contingency envelope. Roleplaying stops, which is troubling.
Armand opens the envelope and reads "you were lovers long ago."
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
       That would entirely change how Armand would greet Esmerelda. The
player probably did it wrong because they didn't know what the character
would. This is relevant. Furthermore, how the relationship ended would
make a big difference in this new greeting.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
    <span class="hidden">
  Other characters will react based on what they see. It might be relevant politically that Armand and Esmerelda have a history. If all a third character saw was the botched introduction, they
might come away with the wrong information. 
</span>

<section class="slide" id="Relevant is Key" label="Relevant is Key">
  <h2>Relevant is Key</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        If it's relevant, it belongs in the character sheet. At a minimum, the
character sheet must contain all of the relevant information needed to play
the part.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        This does not mean all of the details are correct; the information is there as
the character sees it or knows it.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
       If d'Artagnan had a relevant argument with Louis over the meaning of
honor, it has to be in both characters. That d'Artagnan sees it as the last
chance to persuade Louis to be a decent King, and that Louis sees it as yet
another nagging annoyance, is perfectly reasonable.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
</section>




<section class="slide" id="Consistency is So Important" label="Consistency is So Important">
  <h2>Consistency is So Important</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        Even though Louis thought the argument unimportant, it has to be in his
character sheet.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Consider a dramatic moment in game, where d'Artagnan is facing down
the King. d'Artagnan refers to the conversation: "I told you that honor was
key, that it would make you a better King, yet here we are." If Louis replies
"You never told me that," it destroys the moment, and can kill a game.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
       Worse yet, they metagame for a moment and say "the GMs screwed it up."
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
       Always, always, always, make a consistency pass after you've written the
game. If X and Y were both together at Z, it has to be in both sheets, so they
can both play with it. This is where a new set of eyes really helps.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
      <span class="hidden">
  You have to start consistent and keep checking as you write. Then you still have to have someone else read it. My son Jordan reads everything I write, and
he sees things I thought I fixed.

<section class="slide" id="Details Enhance the Picture" label="Details Enhance the Picture">
  <h2>Details Enhance the Picture</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        Once you have all of the relevant pieces in place, embellish and add.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Details give characters something to talk about when they're first getting
together. "I grew up in Paris, and loved to walk through the Latin quarter,
smelling the aromas from the bistros, watching the tourists as the
maitre'd's competed for customers."
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
       Details give characters something to share in quiet intimate, moments. It
can be a way to connect. "I knew your son well, he talked of you and your
farm often, in the lulls between battles."
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
       Details give characters a sense of how to play them. Write the part as
compassionate or cold, optimistic or pessimistic, and so on. Use details to
paint the broad strokes for the player to refine into their interpretation.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>

<section class="slide" id="Bluesheets are Your Friend" label="Bluesheets are Your Friend">
  <h2>Bluesheets are Your Friend</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        Sometimes, you can push common information into bluesheets.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Bluesheets are pages that contain additional information, not written in a
character-specific way. They are typically printed on blue (or green) paper.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
       If you find yourself writing the same text over and over again, consider
pushing it into a shared bluesheet. It's quite reasonable to share a bluesheet
between a small number of characters.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
       If the interpretation of the common event differs significantly, you may not
be able to use a bluesheet. Or, you can cheat. You can say "See the X
bluesheet, but this is what you really think."

      <p>
       I have an archaeologist character in The Idol Hands of Death who has finally
gotten the chance to go on the dig he's dreamed of. I thought I'd made it
absolutely clear that the dig was his focus, to the exclusion of nearly
everything else. In one run, a player announced that he was giving it all
up. When I pulled the player aside, he explained his reasons, which made
sense - but it was a very different interpretation than I expected.
