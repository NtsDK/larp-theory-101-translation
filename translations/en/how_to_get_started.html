  <h2>Keep It Simple</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        Your global story concept should be simple to describe. If it takes more
than a sentence or two, you haven't simplified it enough.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <i>Collision Imminent!</i> - A horde of passengers trying to escape from a dying
starship, and the crew trying to help them. Starship Titanic.

        <i>The Idol Hands of Death</i> - An archaeological expedition in Egypt in 1921
invites interesting people to see what they've found, and there's a murder.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Given this, you have a focus. Now you can work on the story concepts that
will tell the global story. Each character will have their own story concept
inside of and related to the global story.

        Virgil Thorne, a Toreador vampire, a painter struggling with his Sire

    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        All great characters to play, but what would they <i>do</i> together? You have to
start with the global story and the story concepts that tell that global story.
That will define the characters. It will also tell you how many characters.

        Characters are important, and definitely jot down your notes, but consider
the follConsider a simple basic story concept: "You love your father. You hate
your father." Each character should have their own story concept that
helps to build the global story.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        This is a coming-of-age story, a finding oneself story, a classic. Classics are
that way for a reason. Don't be afraid to use and adapt a classic. How
many flavors have we seen of <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> or the Hero Cycle?
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        There's conflict right there, which means drama. There's a choice to be
made. Having to make choices is key.

        It's the foundation for a child character, but what's the character going to
<i>do in the game</i>? Standing around in some kind of mental anguish is not
going to be much fun, or last for very long before most players get bored.

        You need a "To Do" list for each character.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Character ideas can help in building the To Do list, but they aren't
necessary. The To Do list <i>will</i> suggest things about the character.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Clearly, this is a story about conflict with a father, so the To Do list might
include taking an action attempting to gain approval. Alternatively, the
character might do something knowing it risks disapproval. 
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        So, one item on the To Do list might be "Host an event, so you can
demonstrate your organizational and leadership skills for your father."
This involves at least two characters - the father and the child.

<section class="slide" id="Isn't that just plot?" label="Isn't that just plot?">
  <h2>Isn't that just plot?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        An action on the To Do list isn't the same thing as a plot. A plot is driven
by actions on the To Do lists of all of the characters involved in the plot.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        "Hosting an event" is not a plot. What happens at the event, however, is
driven by plot - and hopefully by a lot of them interacting with each other.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Thinking about potential plots will define To Do items that can be
distributed to characters in the game. 
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        "Hosting an event" is part of a goal or a set of them. The child character
will want the event to look good. The father character may have goals
based on the event, and has his own decision to make - whether to approve
or disapprove.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <span class="hidden">
  Being pregnant is not a plot. Give messy birth to the demon child mid-game is a bit cliche, but it's a To Do.

  <ul>

      <p>
        Consider a second child for the father, with a similar, but subtly different
story concept: "You hate your father. You love your father." This suggests
an entirely different dynamic between the father and this child.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        There's also a story between the two children: "Father always loved the
first one more." Sibling rivalry - another classic!
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        This adds a To Do to the second child - make #1 look bad. There's a To Do
for the first child - figure out what #2 is up to and stop it.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        One triangle is clear: the first child wants to succeed, the second child
wants the first to fail, and the father must decide the result, reacting
accordingly.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <span class="hidden">
  Note that I've described this without any details about the children. These details can drive the story in diferent directions. Consider how the story can difer depending on the ages and

groups of characters?

  <h2>More triangles, please!</h2>
  <ul>

        Consider a romantic interest for the first child, with a "star-crossed lovers"
story concept. The To Do item is "introduce the lover to the father.""
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        This new character has all sorts of potential triangles. Consider a triangle
between the father, the lover, and the second child. The father wants to
know the details of the lover's history. (A To Do!) The lover doesn't want
to have that history come out. The second child has to determine what to
say to the father.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        If the second child doesn't know the history, this adds another To Do -
"find out the lover's history." Depending on the story you're trying to tell
will drive what the second child is looking for, what they find, and what
they might do with that knowledge.
      </p>

  Time period, genre, gender of the lover - all these and more add important flavor to the story.

driving a player nuts in the process, and potentially wrecking a game. 
      </p>

    <li>

        If I ask the lover "do you have a sleazy past?" - they're going to lie. If I ask

        In one game, I was looking for a map. The characters that had the

to the map.

    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
       They had a scrap of paper with words that said nothing about a map. They
had nothing in their character background that said what the scraps of
paper were about. (Players know they're important, which might be a
reason not to reveal them.) They were the only ones in game who knew.
      </p>

        As you're thinking about stories, characters, To Dos, triangles, plots, and

    </li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <b>Would This Be Fun To Play?</b>

    </ul>

      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        I was the GM. The player, playing a safecracker character, came up to me
and said "I go to the office and break into the safe. What do I find?" In
many games, this is exactly the right approach. He expected me to invoke
a mechanic, do a quick description, and hand him some item cards.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
       "I don't know," I replied. "You'll have to find it and tell me." It really
threw the player. In this game, there was a real safe in a real office space,
with things inside it. He wasn't expecting that, and it made his game more
of a challenge.

He talked about how his heart had been racing at nearly being caught. Once in the safe, there was more than he expected, and he had to take more precious time to find exactly what he was
looking for. Then, when it was in his hands, he had to figure out how to hide the bulky object for the rest of the game.
