<section class="slide" id="whatislarp3" label="So, what is LARP?">
  <h2>So, what is LARP?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        A LARP is live action. It has people interacting with each other, acting out
their intentions. The players don’t describe actions to a moderating GM.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        A LARP tells a story. It may be small or it may be epic.!
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        A LARP has players playing characters with character-specific goals.!
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        A LARP is improvised. Players make choices and drive the action, outside
of Game Master control.!
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        A LARP has no audience. The players are the audience.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        This definition is squishy and open-ended. There’s a lot that LARP can be.
Don’t be afraid to experiment.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>

<section class="slide" id="twelveRulesToLiveBy" label="Twelve Rules to Live By">
  <h2>Twelve Rules to Live By</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        There are a dozen useful rules to keep in mind as you’re designing and
writing a LARP.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        These are guidelines that shouldn’t be broken.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        They’re nothing new - I wrote these rules for a Usenet discussion in 1997;
they worked for me before then, and I use them to this day.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
</section>


<section class="slide" id="Rule1InterestingCharacters" label="Rule 1: Interesting Characters">
  <h2>Rule 1: Interesting Characters</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        Role-playing is about getting inside the head of another person and letting
them live for a while.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Characters should be rich, full characters with shades of gray.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        “Actors love mental disorders, dialects, and corsets. Give them one of the
three and they’re happy.” Robin Tunney from The Mentalist
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        There has to be more than just shtic, though. An accent or a limp is not
enough.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section class="slide" id="Rule2InterestingStories" label="Rule 2: Interesting Stories">
  <h2>Rule 2: Interesting Stories</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        Not plots - stories. They are NOT the same.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Life is a tale, with a complex set of events and people that have gotten you
to this point.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Characters should be similarly detailed, with information that helps the
player know and understand them.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Give the players things they can talk about in game, ways that they can
connect to other characters.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
</section>


<section class="slide" id="Rule3HumanStories" label="Rule 3: Human Stories">
  <h2>Rule 3: Human Stories</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        The most memorable stories are the ones that deal with the things that
make us who and what we are.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Life, love, loss, birth, death, failure, success...
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        They can be very simple at their heart, but very, very powerful to play.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        You don’t even have to be human to tell human stories. Dustpan: The LARP
has a cat’s hairball as a character, and it’s wrestling with issues of identity
and loss.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Saving the world stories are highly overrated and cliche.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  Notes:
  There’s not a single human character in Dustpan, but they all have human drama.
</section>


<section class="slide" id="Rule4ToughDecisions" label="Rule 4: Tough Decisions">
  <h2>Rule 4: Tough Decisions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        Put the character on the spot. Make them choose between difficult options.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Black and white decisions can be too easy. The more shades of gray, the
better. 
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Do I keep a sacred oath that I’ve been entrusted with, and, by doing so,
allow a war to break out, one that will kill millions? Do I break the oath,
challenge my religious tenets, risk my own imminent death, all to save
nameless strangers? How do I decide this as I am scrambling to recover
something that could bring death and destruction on my own people,
some of whom have interpreted my attempts to help them as heresy?
(Tabula Rasa v2.0)
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Give the player a good reason for each of the options.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
</section>


<section class="slide" id="Rule5Repercussions" label="Rule 5: Repercussions">
  <h2>Rule 5: Repercussions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        There have to be repercussions.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Pulling a gun in real life is not a trivial act, yet look how often it happens
in LARPs.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        I should not be able to get away with murder. 
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Make the players live with the consequences of their actions, and give
those consequences teeth.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
</section>



<section class="slide" id="Rule6ThingstoDoInGame" label="Rule 6: Things to Do In Game">
  <h2>Rule 6: Things to Do In Game</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        You can never have too many plots.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Too many games are seriously underplotted, where things drag for some
(or all) of the characters, especially in longer games.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        The real fun happens when a player realizes that she’s been running nonstop for the entire game, without a moment to catch her breath.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        A bored player is a dangerous player. They can wreck a game.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  Notes:
  A bored player, with a gun, in a game where there are no consequences on opening fire, can ruin the experience for everyone, especially you. The story of
that will live on in the LARP community.
</section>


<section class="slide" id="Rule7AChancetobeNoticed" label="Rule 7: A Chance to be Noticed">
  <h2>Rule 7: A Chance to be Noticed</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        All players aren’t created equal. Some are better at playing than others.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        All characters should be more equal.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Everyone should have a chance for a great part, for a dramatic moment, or
a time when everyone turns to them for an answer.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Why would I want to play Third Spear Carrier from the Left? Why is my
character’s story less important than someone else’s?
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        You never know when someone is really going to surprise you.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  Notes:
  When people came out of Conjunction, everyone was arguing, because everyone believed that the 20+ character game had been centered around them.
That’s ideal.
</section>


<section class="slide" id="Rule8TrySomethingDifferent" label="Rule 8: Try Something Different">
  <h2>Rule 8: Try Something Different</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        Players get typecast. Roles get typecast. LARPs get typecast. Plots get
typecast. Cliche is boring. How many times have you seen:
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        The king/Vampire Prince/boss/head of the family is dead
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Pregnant teenage angst
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Trapped in a house during a storm with a psycho killer
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Just as players need to stretch their role-playing muscles, writers need to
stretch their plotting and character-writing muscles.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Switch it up. Find a new twist. Learn from other writers and games.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  Notes:
These stories can work, if you bring something new to them. !
This also applies to casting... Sure - I might be exactly what you see as the person to play General Hiram Cork, the blood and guts boss of the San Inguon military base and defender of
America against the Commie threat. However, I might also like the chance to play
Tony "Scooter" Turrelli, the unappreciated teenager who was always 2nd in everything at the local school. One is a commanding role, in the middle of a lot of the action, driving the game at
every turn. The other is far more of a
character role, dealing with the far more mundane crises of adolescence. I might not be what you had in mind for the part - and I might not be the best person to play the part - but give me
the chance. (In my case, I actually played both
characters in diferent runs of "I Was a Teenage Mutant From Outer Space!" Both were great fun!)
</section>



<section class="slide" id="Rule9ACharacterInvolved" label="Rule 9: A Character Involved">
  <h2>Rule 9: A Character Involved</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        Outsiders who have little connection to a game aren’t much fun.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Characters that are ostracized by everyone can quickly lose their luster.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Why should I play a character who is only there to be abused?
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Make sure every character has connections to several others in game, in
some way. Give them reasons to talk to each other.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  Notes:
It doesn’t have to be some sequence of cosmic coincidences in the backstory. The stranger who turns out to be a medic can be very valuable. !
An uninvolved/ostracized character can get bored very quickly. In Return to Bora Gora, I was ostracized. I was also the only one with the combination to the safe with the nuke. There was
panic when I went missing.
</section>


<section class="slide" id="Rule10AChanceatSuccess" label="Rule 10: A Chance at Success">
  <h2>Rule 10: A Chance at Success</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        You can stack the odds against me - but as long as I think there’s a chance,
I’ll be engaged and I’ll have fun.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        If a character’s only purpose is to go down for the big fall, then it’s
probably not going to be fun. If I don’t stand a chance, and all there is to do
is to flail at impossible goals, I won’t be happy
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Unless you tell me about it beforehand, so the player can plan accordingly.
They can play it for all it’s worth. This rewrites the goals - the meaning of
“success” becomes very different. The doomed character can give their
opponents a real challenge, and that makes a better game for everyone.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  Notes:
You’ve worked very hard to set up contradicting goals in characters. Why risk it by having a player rewrite their own goals? !
Don’t change the rules of the game halfway through.
</section>



<section class="slide" id="Rule11MakingtheBestofGood Players" label="Rule 11: Making the Best of Good Players">
  <h2>Rule 11: Making the Best of Good Players</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        Nothing makes a game greater for a player than the chance to interact with
someone who’s really good at it. It usually makes their own play better.
Give them the chance to do so whenever you can.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Good players can make a weak game stronger, and can pull other people
along in the process.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Chemistry happens with the right elements.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        You never know where those combinations are going to come from, so you
have to mix people up. 
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        This means you want a LOT of interactions, among a lot of characters.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  Notes:
I call them the “Phone Book Players” - you can throw anything at them and the game will be great.
</section>


<section class="slide" id="Rule12PlaywithoutInterruption" label="Rule 12: Play without Interruption">
  <h2>Rule 12: Play without Interruption</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        When my character gets rolling, don’t stop me. Nothing breaks a game
faster for me than having to step out and do something to facilitate the
game.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        I never want to roll a die, throw Rock/Paper/Scissors, add a modifier,
reread a special ability card, search through index cards for an item, or
remember some mechanic, if I don’t have to. It breaks the role-playing. It
breaks the mood.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Consider the great moments you’ve had when LARPing. The really great
moments probably came when you were pouring your heart and soul into
the character, without a mechanic in sight.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  Notes:
Confessing my sins and my heresy to the Pope, one on one. Competing socially with Lancelot to try to keep Guenevere with me, even as I knew I was
losing. Painting a canvas as a Toreador vampire, keeping the easel between me and the Hunters who were there in an uneasy truce.

        You have an inspiration for a game - it can be anything. A clever title, a

enough.

        A clever mechanic is rarely a good place to start. It’s an easy place for

        Your global story concept should be simple to describe. If it takes more
than a sentence or two, you haven’t simplified it enough.

        Given this, you have a focus. Now you can work on the story concepts that

inside of and related to the global story.

        All great characters to play, but what would they do together? You have to
start with the global story and the story concepts that tell that global story.
That will define the characters. It will also tell you how many characters.

        Characters are important, and definitely jot down your notes, but consider
the follConsider a simple basic story concept: “You love your father. You hate
your father.” Each character should have their own story concept that
helps to build the global story.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        This is a coming-of-age story, a finding oneself story, a classic. Classics are
that way for a reason. Don’t be afraid to use and adapt a classic. How
many flavors have we seen of Romeo and Juliet or the Hero Cycle?
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        There’s conflict right there, which means drama. There’s a choice to be
made. Having to make choices is key.
      </p>

    <li>
      <p>
        It’s the foundation for a child character, but what’s the character going to
do in the game? Standing around in some kind of mental anguish is not
going to be much fun, or last for very long before most players get bored.

  <h2>I didn’t see that coming...</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        You need a “To Do” list for each character.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Character ideas can help in building the To Do list, but they aren’t
necessary. The To Do list will suggest things about the character.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Clearly, this is a story about conflict with a father, so the To Do list might
include taking an action attempting to gain approval. Alternatively, the
character might do something knowing it risks disapproval. 
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        So, one item on the To Do list might be “Host an event, so you can
demonstrate your organizational and leadership skills for your father.”
This involves at least two characters - the father and the child.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>

<section class="slide" id="Isntthatjustplot?" label="Isn’t that just plot?">
  <h2>Isn’t that just plot?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        An action on the To Do list isn’t the same thing as a plot. A plot is driven
by actions on the To Do lists of all of the characters involved in the plot.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        “Hosting an event” is not a plot. What happens at the event, however, is
driven by plot - and hopefully by a lot of them interacting with each other.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Thinking about potential plots will define To Do items that can be
distributed to characters in the game. 
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        “Hosting an event” is part of a goal or a set of them. The child character
will want the event to look good. The father character may have goals
based on the event, and has his own decision to make - whether to approve
or disapprove.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  Being pregnant is not a plot. Give messy birth to the demon child mid-game is a bit cliche, but it’s a To Do.

        This could be a very interesting but short LARP between the two

  <h2>The Golden Triangle</h2>
  <ul>

        Conflicts and decisions add
drama to characters, and gets
them to interact. Consider the

  <h2>Add a story with a Triangle</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        Consider a second child for the father, with a similar, but subtly different
story concept: “You hate your father. You love your father.” This suggests
an entirely different dynamic between the father and this child.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        There’s also a story between the two children: “Father always loved the
first one more.” Sibling rivalry - another classic!
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        This adds a To Do to the second child - make #1 look bad. There’s a To Do
for the first child - figure out what #2 is up to and stop it.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        One triangle is clear: the first child wants to succeed, the second child
wants the first to fail, and the father must decide the result, reacting
accordingly.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  Note that I’ve described this without any details about the children. These details can drive the story in diferent directions. Consider how the story can difer depending on the ages and
genders of the children. Consider how the story can difer if each child was from a diferent mother. What’s the global story you’re trying to tell? Are there some consistent themes spanning
groups of characters?

  <h2>More triangles, please!</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        Consider a romantic interest for the first child, with a “star-crossed lovers”
story concept. The To Do item is “introduce the lover to the father.”
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        This new character has all sorts of potential triangles. Consider a triangle
between the father, the lover, and the second child. The father wants to
know the details of the lover’s history. (A To Do!) The lover doesn’t want
to have that history come out. The second child has to determine what to
say to the father.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        If the second child doesn’t know the history, this adds another To Do -
“find out the lover’s history.” Depending on the story you’re trying to tell
will drive what the second child is looking for, what they find, and what
they might do with that knowledge.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  Time period, genre, gender of the lover - all these and more add important flavor to the story.

  <h2>A Common Fatal Mistake</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        “Find out the lover’s history.” “Find the McGuffin Widget.” These are
common To Dos, intended to drive a lot of plot. Many times these fail,
driving a player nuts in the process, and potentially wrecking a game. 
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        If I ask the lover “do you have a sleazy past?” - they’re going to lie. If I ask
a second character about the lover, they may have skimmed over that part
of their character and don’t remember. I have to keep looking.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
       If there are 20 other players in the game, and it takes me 3 minutes to ask
each one that one question, then that’s an hour I’ve spent trying to solve
one problem. That’s a lot of time and effort, and I have other things to do!
      </p>

    <li>
      <p>
       Information has to exist in more than one place, and there has to be a way to get at
it in those places.

      <p>
        “Find the McGuffin widget” is commonly the result of following a clue
chain - a sequence of steps to get to where you have to go.

    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        In one game, I was looking for a map. The characters that had the
information I needed had it in the form of pieces of a cryptic poem that led
to the map.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
       They had a scrap of paper with words that said nothing about a map. They
had nothing in their character background that said what the scraps of
paper were about. (Players know they’re important, which might be a
reason not to reveal them.) They were the only ones in game who knew.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
       I asked all of them about a map. They didn’t know about a map. I never
found it - and I spent much of a weekend looking for it.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  More information was available - in characters that weren’t cast, because there weren’t enough players to fill those roles. !
Marin County New Age Society failed for me because I was the last one in a chain of events. One of the players decided that they weren’t going to do their step. I was hosed, with no chance
of recovery.

  <h2>The Cardinal Rule</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        As you’re thinking about stories, characters, To Dos, triangles, plots, and

      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Would This Be Fun To Play?
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
       If it’s not fun to play, then why would someone want to do it? This is a
game. It’s entertainment.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>

       If you wouldn’t want to play the part, why would someone else want to?
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
       If the answer is “no”, then strongly consider replacing the game/

dark and twisted stories, just boring or distasteful ones.

  <h2>To Do is to Do</h2>

    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Could this character be replaced by a mannequin or an item card?
      </p>

    <li>
      <p>
       A brilliantly written character means little if all the player has to do is
admire your writing.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
       A character should have To Dos to keep them busy. Other characters
should have To Dos that bring even more action to the first one. There
should be a dense web of interactions, going in all directions.

has a To Do, which looks reasonable.

    <li>
      <p>
        LARP is about acting and interacting. A puzzle does not fit this paradigm.

       Some players hate puzzles. Some players are not good at puzzles. Why is it

having intense interactions?
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
       Of course, it all depends on the puzzle. In the fabulous Curse of Whately’s

  <h2>To Do is to Do Too</h2>
  <ul>

        Consider a To Do that is “Break into a safe and steal the secret plans.”
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        I was the GM. The player, playing a safecracker character, came up to me
and said “I go to the office and break into the safe. What do I find?” In
many games, this is exactly the right approach. He expected me to invoke
a mechanic, do a quick description, and hand him some item cards.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
       “I don’t know,” I replied. “You’ll have to find it and tell me.” It really
threw the player. In this game, there was a real safe in a real office space,
with things inside it. He wasn’t expecting that, and it made his game more
of a challenge.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
       Consider the experience of actually having to do this, while risking being
caught.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  Another player, playing the same part in another run, told me that someone nearly walked in on him as he was going to the safe. He’d had to hide in the room and hope he wasn’t detected.
He talked about how his heart had been racing at nearly being caught. Once in the safe, there was more than he expected, and he had to take more precious time to find exactly what he was
looking for. Then, when it was in his hands, he had to figure out how to hide the bulky object for the rest of the game.

    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        You won’t write it consciously, or in that form, but you have to keep the
position of the character in mind. For many characters, there are points in
games where the best and most logical solution is simply to leave.

        That all depends on the story and sub-stories you’re trying to tell. You can

  Idol Hands of Death started with 20 characters. After the first run, I realized that there were a couple of dangling threads and loose ends. We also had 22 signups for the second run. Tim
Lasko and I sat down and talked about our experiences in the game - and soon had two new characters that filled in some of the holes. They helped to fill out the stories. Players in the
second and third run never realized that we’d added characters. For the fourth run, we realized that we still had some holes, and we knew how we could fill them. Three new characters, tied
in with the others, worked brilliantly. They fit in so well that one of the new characters has gotten several votes as the potential killer, in both of the runs where they were present.

on our story. I couldn’t tell you what happened with the rest of the game.

<section class="slide" id="Variable Sized Games" label="Variable Sized Games">
  <h2>Variable Sized Games</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        Sometimes, you can’t get 20 players for a game.The Away Team, going off on a mission.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        When you drop a character, you’re tearing a hole in the dense web of
interactions you’ve carefully constructed. Some To Dos will be impossible
to complete. Some information will not be as accessible. (If this is the only
source of that information, go back and fix that.) 
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
       This is hard to plan for. It can be done. 
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
       Never write an “extra” character, that is somehow less. The players will
know. All the characters should be equal and integrated with each other.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
       Letting characters get killed off mid-game has similar issues. Writing a
good replacement character is very tough to do well.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
I personally don’t do this. Even with Idol Hands growing from 20 to 22 to 25 characters, those new parts are fully integrated. Remove one and the game
wouldn’t work as well.

<section class="slide" id="12 Characters Walk Into A Bar..." label="12 Characters Walk Into A Bar...">
  <h2>12 Characters Walk Into A Bar...</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        Your characters have spoken, and you have a good idea for the size of the
game. You’ve considered the web of interactions. How long should the
game run?
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        That depends on a couple of factors:
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
       Are you going to put everything into the characters at game start? 
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
       Are you going to introduce external events and significant new information
during the game? (e.g. pages of restored memories)
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
       Are you using mechanics that will take a long time to resolve if things end
in a massive conflict?
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
Inserting information takes time, and information takes time to propagate through the game. !
Variable numbers of characters are hard, because the number of interactions changes dramatically. Plots can break. Start simple, and use a fixed number -
unless you’re doing something like a horde game.

  <h2>So How Long Should It Run?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        Your estimates are TOO LONG.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Be merciless. I’ve rarely met a game that couldn’t be compressed in time.
Doing so puts pressure on the players to act. Time pressure also helps to
prevent slow periods.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
       Give your players a lot to do and not enough time to accomplish
everything. Force them to choose their priorities. Yes, this means that many
of your possible To Dos won’t get finished, but you still have to write
them.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
       Leave the players wanting more. That’s so much better than having
everyone just standing around waiting for the last two people to finish up
their last plot.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
This is also what playtesting is for.

<section class="slide" id="Writing Characters" label="Writing Characters">
  <h2>Writing Characters</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        A game is a collection of characters with things they have to do,
individually and/or collectively. The details and directions that a LARP
will take depend on how those characters will see their tasks and goals,
and how the player interprets them.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        A To Do will be approached very differently depending on whether the
character is a tarnished saint, a depraved sociopath, a sinner seeking
absolution, a selfish manipulator looking only to their own ends, or
something entirely different.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
       Your job is to weave a character into the given set of goals. You probably
already have some good ideas about them, but listen as they tell you about
themselves. They may surprise you.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
</section>



<section class="slide" id="How Long Should a Character Be?" label="How Long Should a Character Be?">
  <h2>How Long Should a Character Be?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        That depends on the number of To Dos, the length of the game, and the
depth you want to give your characters.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        “You don’t remember.” is the shortest legitimate character sheet I know.
That doesn’t go very far. Either the character will get their memory back,
requiring a longer description, or other characters will have to know what
happened, which means their sheets are longer.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
       Three sentences can totally work, for a game like FOCUS: the Generic LARP.
There was a surprisingly rich environment, and everyone had a clear
archetype to play.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
       Three sentences (or less) can fail totally, like in Slave Girls of the Terror Dome,
where nothing was connected or made sense.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>

<section class="slide" id="Where Is the Character Information?" label="Where Is the Character Information?">
  <h2>Where Is the Character Information?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        Character information is often spread into several pieces. Consider a game
with d’Artagnan, of The Three Musketeers. From most specific to most
generic, details about his character could be:
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        In his character biography (e.g. d’Artagnan’s personal history)
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
       Introduced in the game, via contingency envelopes or arrival information.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
       In small-group or description bluesheets (e.g. A Musketeer’s bluesheet,
French court politics, etc.)
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
       In public materials (e.g. common knowledge of events at the court, history
of duels, etc.)
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
</section>




<section class="slide" id="Which of those Places Do I Choose?" label="Which of those Places Do I Choose?">
  <h2>Which of those Places Do I Choose?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        It’s clearly easier and more private to put more useful and specific
information about how a character thinks in the most specific materials -
the character biography.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        To say that d’Artagnan was passionately in love with the Queen and how
he feels is not something publicly known.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
       If it’s relevant, it belongs in the biography.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
</section>



<section class="slide" id="How will the Choice Affect Game Play?" label="How will the Choice Affect Game Play?">
  <h2>How will the Choice Affect Game Play?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        Consider Armand, who is given a contingency envelope that says “Open
when you meet Esmerelda.”
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Armand meets several characters, and then is introduced to Esmerelda.
Armand introduces himself as he has to all of the other characters he
doesn’t know.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
       There’s that contingency envelope. Roleplaying stops, which is troubling.
Armand opens the envelope and reads “you were lovers long ago.”
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
       That would entirely change how Armand would greet Esmerelda. The
player probably did it wrong because they didn’t know what the character
would. This is relevant. Furthermore, how the relationship ended would
make a big difference in this new greeting.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  Other characters will react based on what they see. It might be relevant politically that Armand and Esmerelda have a history. If all a third character saw was the botched introduction, they
might come away with the wrong information. !
</section>




<section class="slide" id="Relevant is Key" label="Relevant is Key">
  <h2>Relevant is Key</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        If it’s relevant, it belongs in the character sheet. At a minimum, the
character sheet must contain all of the relevant information needed to play
the part.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        This does not mean all of the details are correct; the information is there as
the character sees it or knows it.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
       If d’Artagnan had a relevant argument with Louis over the meaning of
honor, it has to be in both characters. That d’Artagnan sees it as the last
chance to persuade Louis to be a decent King, and that Louis sees it as yet
another nagging annoyance, is perfectly reasonable.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
</section>




<section class="slide" id="Consistency is So Important" label="Consistency is So Important">
  <h2>Consistency is So Important</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        Even though Louis thought the argument unimportant, it has to be in his
character sheet.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Consider a dramatic moment in game, where d’Artagnan is facing down
the King. d’Artagnan refers to the conversation: “I told you that honor was
key, that it would make you a better King, yet here we are.” If Louis replies
“You never told me that,” it destroys the moment, and can kill a game.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
       Worse yet, they metagame for a moment and say “the GMs screwed it up.”
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
       Always, always, always, make a consistency pass after you’ve written the
game. If X and Y were both together at Z, it has to be in both sheets, so they
can both play with it. This is where a new set of eyes really helps.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  You have to start consistent and keep checking as you write. Then you still have to have someone else read it. My son Jordan reads everything I write, and
he sees things I thought I fixed.

<section class="slide" id="Details Enhance the Picture" label="Details Enhance the Picture">
  <h2>Details Enhance the Picture</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        Once you have all of the relevant pieces in place, embellish and add.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Details give characters something to talk about when they’re first getting
together. “I grew up in Paris, and loved to walk through the Latin quarter,
smelling the aromas from the bistros, watching the tourists as the
maitre’d’s competed for customers.”
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
       Details give characters something to share in quiet intimate, moments. It
can be a way to connect. “I knew your son well, he talked of you and your
farm often, in the lulls between battles.”
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
       Details give characters a sense of how to play them. Write the part as
compassionate or cold, optimistic or pessimistic, and so on. Use details to
paint the broad strokes for the player to refine into their interpretation.
      </p>
