        Any rule can be bent, or even broken, if you're careful. Usually, breaking a

<section class="slide" id="So, what is LARP?" label="So, what is LARP?">
  <h2>So, what is LARP?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        A LARP is live action. It has people interacting with each other, acting out
their intentions. The players don’t describe actions to a moderating GM.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        A LARP tells a story. It may be small or it may be epic.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        A LARP has players playing characters with character-specific goals.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        A LARP is improvised. Players make choices and drive the action, outside
of Game Master control.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        A LARP has no audience. The players are the audience.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        This definition is squishy and open-ended. There’s a lot that LARP can be.
Don’t be afraid to experiment.

  <h2>Twelve Rules to Live By</h2>

    <li>
      <p>
        There are a dozen useful rules to keep in mind as you're designing and
writing a LARP.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        These are guidelines that shouldn't be broken.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        They're nothing new - I wrote these rules for a Usenet discussion in 1997;
they worked for me before then, and I use them to this day.

<section class="slide" id="Rule 1: Interesting Characters" label="Rule 1: Interesting Characters">
  <h2>Rule 1: Interesting Characters</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        Role-playing is about getting inside the head of another person and letting
them live for a while.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Characters should be rich, full characters with shades of gray.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
      "Actors love mental disorders, dialects, and corsets. Give them one of the
three and they're happy." Robin Tunney from <i>The Mentalist</i>
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        There has to be more than just shtic, though. An accent or a limp is not
enough.

  </ul>

<section class="slide" id="Rule 2: Interesting Stories" label="Rule 2: Interesting Stories">
  <h2>Rule 2: Interesting Stories</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        Not plots - stories. They are NOT the same.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Life is a tale, with a complex set of events and people that have gotten you
to this point.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Characters should be similarly detailed, with information that helps the
player know and understand them.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Give the players things they can talk about in game, ways that they can
connect to other characters.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
</section>


<section class="slide" id="Rule 3: Human Stories" label="Rule 3: Human Stories">
  <h2>Rule 3: Human Stories</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        The most memorable stories are the ones that deal with the things that
make us who and what we are.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Life, love, loss, birth, death, failure, success...
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        They can be very simple at their heart, but very, very powerful to play.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        You don't even have to be human to tell human stories. <i>Dustpan: The LARP</i>
has a cat's hairball as a character, and it's wrestling with issues of identity
and loss.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Saving the world stories are highly overrated and cliche.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <span class="hidden">
  There's not a single human character in Dustpan, but they all have human drama.

<section class="slide" id="Rule 4: Tough Decisions" label="Rule 4: Tough Decisions">
  <h2>Rule 4: Tough Decisions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        Put the character on the spot. Make them choose between difficult options.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Black and white decisions can be too easy. The more shades of gray, the
better. 
      </p>
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Do I keep a sacred oath that I've been entrusted with, and, by doing so,
  allow a war to break out, one that will kill millions? Do I break the oath,
  challenge my religious tenets, risk my own imminent death, all to save
  nameless strangers? How do I decide this as I am scrambling to recover
  something that could bring death and destruction on my own people,
  some of whom have interpreted my attempts to help them as heresy?
  (<i>Tabula Rasa v2.0</i>)
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        Give the player a good reason for each of the options.

<section class="slide" id="Rule 5: Repercussions" label="Rule 5: Repercussions">
  <h2>Rule 5: Repercussions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        There have to be repercussions.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Pulling a gun in real life is not a trivial act, yet look how often it happens
in LARPs.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        I should not be able to get away with murder.

        Make the players live with the consequences of their actions, and give
those consequences teeth.

<section class="slide" id="Rule 6: Things to Do In Game" label="Rule 6: Things to Do In Game">
  <h2>Rule 6: Things to Do In Game</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        You can never have too many plots.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Too many games are seriously underplotted, where things drag for some
(or all) of the characters, especially in longer games.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        The real fun happens when a player realizes that she's been running nonstop for the entire game, without a moment to catch her breath.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        A bored player is a dangerous player. They can wreck a game.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <span class="hidden">
  Notes:
  A bored player, with a gun, in a game where there are no consequences on opening fire, can ruin the experience for everyone, especially you. The story of
that will live on in the LARP community.

<section class="slide" id="Rule 7: A Chance to be Noticed" label="Rule 7: A Chance to be Noticed">
  <h2>Rule 7: A Chance to be Noticed</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        All players aren't created equal. Some are better at playing than others.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        All characters should be more equal.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Everyone should have a chance for a great part, for a dramatic moment, or
a time when everyone turns to them for an answer.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Why would I want to play Third Spear Carrier from the Left? Why is my
character's story less important than someone else's?
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        You never know when someone is really going to surprise you.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  Notes:
  When people came out of Conjunction, everyone was arguing, because everyone believed that the 20+ character game had been centered around them.
That's ideal.

<section class="slide" id="Rule 8: Try Something Different" label="Rule 8: Try Something Different">
  <h2>Rule 8: Try Something Different</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        Players get typecast. Roles get typecast. LARPs get typecast. Plots get
typecast. Cliche is boring. How many times have you seen:
      </p>
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          The king/Vampire Prince/boss/head of the family is dead

        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        Just as players need to stretch their role-playing muscles, writers need to
stretch their plotting and character-writing muscles.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Switch it up. Find a new twist. Learn from other writers and games.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <span class="hidden">
These stories can work, if you bring something new to them. !
This also applies to casting... Sure - I might be exactly what you see as the person to play General Hiram Cork, the blood and guts boss of the San Inguon military base and defender of
America against the Commie threat. However, I might also like the chance to play
Tony "Scooter" Turrelli, the unappreciated teenager who was always 2nd in everything at the local school. One is a commanding role, in the middle of a lot of the action, driving the game at
every turn. The other is far more of a
character role, dealing with the far more mundane crises of adolescence. I might not be what you had in mind for the part - and I might not be the best person to play the part - but give me
the chance. (In my case, I actually played both
characters in diferent runs of "I Was a Teenage Mutant From Outer Space!" Both were great fun!)

<section class="slide" id="Rule 9: A Character Involved" label="Rule 9: A Character Involved">
  <h2>Rule 9: A Character Involved</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        Outsiders who have little connection to a game aren't much fun.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Characters that are ostracized by everyone can quickly lose their luster.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Why should I play a character who is only there to be abused?
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Make sure every character has connections to several others in game, in
some way. Give them reasons to talk to each other.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <span class="hidden">
  Notes:
It doesn't have to be some sequence of cosmic coincidences in the backstory. The stranger who turns out to be a medic can be very valuable. !
An uninvolved/ostracized character can get bored very quickly. In Return to Bora Gora, I was ostracized. I was also the only one with the combination to the safe with the nuke. There was
panic when I went missing.

<section class="slide" id="Rule 10: A Chance at Success" label="Rule 10: A Chance at Success">
  <h2>Rule 10: A Chance at Success</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        You can stack the odds against me - but as long as I think there's a chance,
I'll be engaged and I'll have fun.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        If a character's only purpose is to go down for the big fall, then it's
probably not going to be fun. If I don't stand a chance, and all there is to do
is to flail at impossible goals, I won't be happy
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Unless you tell me about it <i>beforehand</i>, so the player can plan accordingly.
They can play it for all it's worth. This rewrites the goals - the meaning of
"success" becomes very different. The doomed character can give their
opponents a real challenge, and that makes a better game for everyone.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <span class="hidden">
  Notes:
You've worked very hard to set up contradicting goals in characters. Why risk it by having a player rewrite their own goals? !
Don't change the rules of the game halfway through.

  <h2>Rule 11: Making the Best of Good Players</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        Nothing makes a game greater for a player than the chance to interact with
someone who's really good at it. It usually makes their own play better.
Give them the chance to do so whenever you can.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Good players can make a weak game stronger, and can pull other people
along in the process.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Chemistry happens with the right elements.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        You never know where those combinations are going to come from, so you
have to mix people up. 
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        This means you want a LOT of interactions, among a lot of characters.

        When my character gets rolling, don't stop me. Nothing breaks a game

remember some mechanic, if I don't have to. It breaks the role-playing. It
breaks the mood.

the character, without a mechanic in sight.

        This is a coming-of-age story, a finding oneself story, a classic. Classics are

    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Character ideas can help in building the To Do list, but they aren't

    <li>

    <li>
      <p>
        "Hosting an event" is not a plot. What happens at the event, however, is

      <p>
        "Hosting an event" is part of a goal or a set of them. The child character
will want the event to look good. The father character may have goals
based on the event, and has his own decision to make - whether to approve
or disapprove.

        Consider a second child for the father, with a similar, but subtly different
story concept: "You hate your father. You love your father." This suggests
an entirely different dynamic between the father and this child.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        There's also a story between the two children: "Father always loved the

      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        This adds a To Do to the second child - make #1 look bad. There's a To Do
for the first child - figure out what #2 is up to and stop it.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        One triangle is clear: the first child wants to succeed, the second child
wants the first to fail, and the father must decide the result, reacting
accordingly.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <span class="hidden">
  Note that I've described this without any details about the children. These details can drive the story in diferent directions. Consider how the story can difer depending on the ages and

groups of characters?

      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        This new character has all sorts of potential triangles. Consider a triangle
between the father, the lover, and the second child. The father wants to
know the details of the lover's history. (A To Do!) The lover doesn't want
to have that history come out. The second child has to determine what to
say to the father.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        If the second child doesn't know the history, this adds another To Do -
"find out the lover's history." Depending on the story you're trying to tell
will drive what the second child is looking for, what they find, and what
they might do with that knowledge.
      </p>

       They had a scrap of paper with words that said nothing about a map. They

reason not to reveal them.) They were the only ones in game who knew.

      <p>
        I was the GM. The player, playing a safecracker character, came up to me
and said "I go to the office and break into the safe. What do I find?" In
many games, this is exactly the right approach. He expected me to invoke
a mechanic, do a quick description, and hand him some item cards.

       "I don't know," I replied. "You'll have to find it and tell me." It really

with things inside it. He wasn't expecting that, and it made his game more
of a challenge.

He talked about how his heart had been racing at nearly being caught. Once in the safe, there was more than he expected, and he had to take more precious time to find exactly what he was
looking for. Then, when it was in his hands, he had to figure out how to hide the bulky object for the rest of the game.

  Idol Hands of Death started with 20 characters. After the first run, I realized that there were a couple of dangling threads and loose ends. We also had 22 signups for the second run. Tim
Lasko and I sat down and talked about our experiences in the game - and soon had two new characters that filled in some of the holes. They helped to fill out the stories. Players in the
second and third run never realized that we’d added characters. For the fourth run, we realized that we still had some holes, and we knew how we could fill them. Three new characters, tied
in with the others, worked brilliantly. They fit in so well that one of the new characters has gotten several votes as the potential killer, in both of the runs where they were present.

        A game is a collection of characters with things they have to do,

something entirely different.

        "You don't remember." is the shortest legitimate character sheet I know.

        Consider a dramatic moment in game, where d'Artagnan is facing down
the King. d'Artagnan refers to the conversation: "I told you that honor was
key, that it would make you a better King, yet here we are." If Louis replies

       I have an archaeologist character in The Idol Hands of Death who has finally
gotten the chance to go on the dig he's dreamed of. I thought I'd made it
absolutely clear that the dig was his focus, to the exclusion of nearly
everything else. In one run, a player announced that he was giving it all
up. When I pulled the player aside, he explained his reasons, which made
sense - but it was a very different interpretation than I expected.

what happened.
      </p>

    <li>
      <p>

        The Problem Solver likes to solve puzzles, investigate clues, follow up on

       I tend to write murderer characters who need to get away with it for most
of the game as a Problem Solver. A Problem Solver player in the role keeps
them focused, dancing as the noose tightens.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
       A Role Player might stay too much in character to get away with it.

role-playing with special abilities and combat.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        This may be as simple as using a boffer weapon or Nerf gun in livecombat. It may be as involved as using dice, cards, a war game, or
something else to simulate something not physically possible or
reasonable.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        The Gunslinger prefers these elements in their play. They may step out of
the role-playing moment to invoke these mechanics - and it is not limited
to combat.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        The Gunslinger would rather pull out a "Fast Talk" ability card than try to
actually convince someone to do their bidding.

    <li>
      <p>
        The second option is to run with "GM Sanctioned Mayhem Only," which
means if a player wants to do something, they go to a GM who figures out
what happens. There's no need for statistics or detailed special ability
cards, because the GM keeps this in their head.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
